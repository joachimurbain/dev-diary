I'm excited to kick off this dev diary by sharing a little bit about where I'm coming from.

## Where It All Began

Six years ago, I was a carpenter in Belgium, specializing in timber framing. While most people move from office jobs to manual labor, I did it in reverse. I traded in my hammer and saw for a keyboard and a world of code. The shift was as unexpected as it was transformative.

## What Carried Over

Switching careers meant learning a whole new skill set, but some things from timber framing still apply:

- **Problem-solving:** In timber framing, if a beam doesn’t fit, you don’t scrap the whole structure. You find a way to adjust it without compromising integrity. Coding is the same; when something breaks, you analyze the issue, tweak the code, and make it work without tearing everything down.

- **Straight talk:** On job sites, you don’t sugarcoat things. That bluntness helps in tech too. Clear communication gets things done.

- **Attention to detail:** A bad cut can ruin a build; sloppy code does the same. Craftsmanship matters, no matter the medium.

## The Journey So Far

Transitioning to web development wasn’t smooth sailing. There were challenges and moments of self-doubt, but each obstacle taught me something valuable. I don’t regret the decision. Every struggle shaped the developer I am today.

This diary is my space to document every win, failure, and lesson along the way, from woodwork to web work.
