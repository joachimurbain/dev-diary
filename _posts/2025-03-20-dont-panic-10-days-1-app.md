title: "Wattsup: 10 Days, One App, No Panic (Yet)"

I’m at the tail end of a .NET bootcamp, and for the final push, I’ve got 10 days to build something real. Not a tutorial clone. Not a throwaway. This one actually has a purpose, and a deadline.

And, as any seasoned traveler of the universe knows: **Don’t panic.**

## The Setup
I’m wrapping up a **three-month .NET bootcamp**, and now I have **10 days** to build a fully functional app. No pressure, right? **This isn’t another bootcamp toy app; it actually needs to work, and people will use it.**

The app, **Wattsup**, is a **web-based energy monitoring tool** that helps track electricity, gas, and water usage across multiple locations. It needs to handle **meter readings via QR codes, alerts for unusual consumption, and visual analytics**, all while staying secure and easy to use.

## What Could Possibly Go Wrong?
With such a short timeline, I already see a few challenges coming my way:

1. **Tight deadline** – 10 days isn't a lot of time to get everything working.
2. **Graphs and data visualization** – Making numbers look good and actually mean something.
3. **Balancing security and usability** – Lock it down without making users jump through hoops.
4. **Design** – Let’s be real, I don’t love designing UI. But I can’t just ship an ugly app.

## The Game Plan
To keep things moving and avoid digging myself into a hole, I’m sticking to a few key rules:

- **MVP first** – Get the core functionality working, polish later.
- **Build a solid base** – No cutting corners on structure, or future me will suffer.
- **Plan ahead** – Think before I code, so I don’t have to untangle a mess later.

## Let’s See How This Goes
I’ve done production work before, but this one’s got a deadline breathing down my neck and no room to fake it. Over the next few days, I’ll be sharing my progress, struggles, and probably a few rants along the way.

In the meantime, I’ll keep my towel close and hope for the best.

Stay tuned, this should be interesting.
