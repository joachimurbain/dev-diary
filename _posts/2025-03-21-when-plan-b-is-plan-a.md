**Nine days and counting. Let's see how it fares.**

## **The Hackathon Shuffle**

Nine days left until the **Wattsup** deadline, so naturally… I spent the whole morning forming a team for the **Citizen of Wallonia hackathon**.

Quick context: **CoW** (Citizen of Wallonia) is a two-day hackathon where teams build an app around one of four public-interest themes. It’s fast, intense, and over before you know it.

I started laying the groundwork last week. Got a crew of four together early, good spread of skills, good energy. One teammate’s a **PowerPoint wizard**, so we even had polished slides ready to go. The idea felt solid, the scope was clear, and we knew what kind of profiles we needed to pull it off.

This morning was about locking it all in and getting started for real. Bit of maneuvering, some back-and-forth, and we landed right where we wanted to be. **Strong team**, **clear plan**, confidence high.

## **Plot Twist**

Remember when I said we had a **clear plan**?

Yeah, well. Turns out, **half of our idea already exists**. A shiny new app dropped just days ago doing pretty much the same thing.

No big deal. Well… maybe a **little** deal.

While I was still processing the news, our PowerPoint wizard was already **hacking together a plan B** and making short work of it. At least part of the original idea still made sense, and in under two hours, we were back on track. **Smaller scope, but cleaner**. Honestly, it felt more focused.

Then it was onto the technical side. Some chitchat, some honest takes. We threw ideas around.
Everyone had something they wanted to mess with, and somehow, it all lined up.

So we shuffled things around, matched people to stacks, and **boom, coverage**.

- **Design** — check
- **Frontend**, **backend**, **database** — check
- **AI bots**, **data analysis** — weirdly, also check

## **So Where Are We Now?**

Is everything perfectly clear? Not really. But we know what questions we need to answer to keep moving.
It feels good. Like we’re actually getting somewhere again.

And then, **of course**...
It’s already an app. At this point, we’re just inventing apps that already exist.

**Tune in tomorrow, when we find out Plan C was already developed in 1987.**
